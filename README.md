Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

## Overview

This project presents an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that inhabit human navels. The dashboard allows users to visualize microbial species (OTUs) found in different individuals, providing insights into microbial diversity.

## Features

Horizontal Bar Chart: Displays the top 10 OTUs found in the selected individual, using:
sample_values for the bar lengths
otu_ids as labels
otu_labels as hover text
Bubble Chart: Visualizes each sample with:
otu_ids for the x-axis
sample_values for the y-axis and marker size
otu_ids for marker colors
otu_labels for text values on the markers
Metadata Display: Shows demographic information about the selected individual, including age, gender, ethnicity, and more.
Technologies Used

HTML
CSS (optional for styling)
JavaScript
D3.js (for data manipulation and visualization)
Plotly.js (for interactive charts)
